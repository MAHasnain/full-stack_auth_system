# 🔐 Auth System – Next.js & MongoDB

A modern authentication system built using **Next.js** and **MongoDB** to understand and implement **real-world auth flows** with clean architecture and security best practices.

---

## 📌 About the Project

**Auth System** is a learning-focused yet production-inspired project that demonstrates how authentication works behind the scenes in modern web applications.

Instead of building just a basic login/signup form, this project focuses on:
- secure user authentication
- JWT-based authorization
- backend & frontend integration
- environment-based security

The main goal is to build a **strong conceptual foundation of authentication systems** used in real-world products.

## 🚀 Features

- User Signup & Login
- Secure password hashing using **bcrypt**
- JWT (JSON Web Tokens) based authentication
- Token generation & verification
- API routes using Next.js App Router
- MongoDB for persistent user storage
- Proper server-side validation
- Environment variable based security
